- Improved database structure: split into modules (audit, base, comment, message, post, user)
- Migrated database and API field names from French to English for consistency and clarity
- Replaced old `database.py` with structured package `database/`
- Updated and expanded API documentation under `docs-APIs/`, removed outdated `docs/` files
- Cleaned up old HTML test files and moved Python tests into organized `test1/` and `test2/` directories
- Updated `README.md` and utility scripts for new structure
